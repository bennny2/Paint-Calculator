This is my submission for the Telecetera Software Challenge - Paint Calculator
Built with Visual Studio Code using C# and .NET 7

Instructions:

Assumptions:
1. Assuming the user uses a consistent unit (eg. Metres) when inputting data
2. Assuming the room is a cuboid shape
3. Assuming the room has no windows or doors
4. Assuming the floor won't be painted
5. Assuming the user knows what the app is for and what it does
6. Assuming all walls are flat

Improvements to be made (given more time or people):
1. Could add a more accurate reprensentation of paint needed from calculated surface area factoring in coverage capacity and amount of coats
2. Could add functionality for other shapes of rooms (could be done by asking for amoount of walls and each of their measurements)
3. Could use a visual aid to represent room size to double check room sizes inputted make sense, could also make visual representation modifiable
4. Should use a GUI and friendlier user experience
